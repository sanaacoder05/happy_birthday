        <div class="poem">
            <p>In the story of our lives, there was a friend so bright,<br>
            Their smile, like stars, lit up our darkest night.<br>
            They were kind and caring, like the ocean wide,<br>
            With a heart full of love, they stood by our side.</p>

            <p>When we felt low, they lifted our spirits high,<br>
            Their laughter was a song that reached the sky.<br>
            Through thick and thin, they never left our side,<br>
            A friend like them, in them, we confide.</p>

            <p>Though time moves on, their memory stays strong,<br>
            In our hearts forever, where they belong.<br>
            For a friend so special, so rare and true,<br>
            We're grateful for you, and all that you do.</p>
